// Tried 5 or 6 methods for importing Museo Sans, the primary
// font used on the site. Nothing worked, so I resorted to
// the declared fallbacks.

// Since we planned on using two fonts I set up both, though
// they're set to the same declarations. It's less than ideal
// but I don't want to invite errors from undefined variables.
